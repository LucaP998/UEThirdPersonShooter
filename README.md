# Unreal Engine 4 - Third Person Shooter

I made this game back in 2021 and changed the repo visibility to public in 2026.

This is a third person shooter game made with Unreal Engine 4, while following this [Udemy Unreal Engine course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/).

The game has all the fundamental features of this genre:

- Simple enemy AI

- Health system

- Death animations and shooting animations

- Shooting with left click and zooming with right click

- Win condition when all enemies have been defeated
